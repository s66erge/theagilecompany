      <title>How to improve present consciousness and individual agility</title>

      <description>High external pressure pushes us into rumination and stress, away from the present! Most of us assume that the events of life are causing stress. Particularly at work where employees say they have a stressful boss, stressful work, stressful timelines&amp;hellip;. But other employees in the same teams - with the same pressures - are not stressed out. So it&amp;rsquo;s not the event that causes stress.
To convert pressure into stress, you have to add an important intermediary step: rumination.</description>

      <title>Develop your leadership behaviors with the 360 listening/support process</title>
      <link>https://s66erge.github.io/theagilecompany/post/listening-support/</link>

      <description>The objective of this process is to get a range of feedback about the leadership behaviors you could change and then get support from different people to help you effectively change the 1 or 2 most important behaviors you have selected.
There is clear statistical evidence over a population of more than 7,500 managers (see annex 2) that this whole process will trigger your successful leadership behavior changes if you meet your 6 to 8 colleagues once per month over a period of 6 months (see step 7)</description>

      <title>How can we facilitate transformations with agile cooperation and human growth ?</title>

      <description>Modern change approaches integrate the human side, but success rate remains low \
Almost all change and/or transformation programs are based on the findings that collective effectiveness has become too low, usually against evolutions in the environment, and that a major cause is a combination of cooperation and collective agility.
And we all know that the traditional answer to this change imperative lead often to a vicious circle of stress, demotivation and disengagement:</description>

      <title>How to approach the implementation of the strategies?</title>
      <link>https://s66erge.github.io/theagilecompany/post/implementation/</link>

      <description>It must be considered that there is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate a new order of things. For the reformer has enemies in all those who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit by the new order, &amp;hellip; Niccolo Machiavelli, ~1500AC.
 It is not a surprise that the failure rate of large business change management efforts has been high since the 80s.</description>

      <title>Only widespread self-awareness can make traditional management systems sustainable</title>

      <description>All power based hierarchies create these work contexts: Top/Middle/Bottom/Customer Traditional management systems are based on hierarchies with a large discretionary power of bosses over their (direct) reports. So our work experiences are influenced by our perception of the relationship with our direct boss.
 I vividly remember some periods of strong engagement when I was working for Jan or Eddie and the long periods of frustration and powerlessness when working for some of my other previous bosses.</description>

      <title>How can we continuously develop self mastery?</title>

      <description>The foundation of a successful implementation of these strategiesleverage-points] is your own self-mastery, which I will define here as a the sum of these competencies:
 your systemic understanding of the (work) system around us your permanent inquiry of how we can better impact this (work) system your self-awareness, including the alignment of our actions with what we strive for  So how could you continuously develop your own self mastery?</description>

      <description>Managers are facing similar challenges but in different realities: they use different solutions  The HR governance meeting was taking place six weeks after Maria was promoted HR director of the local subsidiary of a global software company. She was confronted with a major challenge: prepare a reorganization of some HR functions, with local HR headcount reduction, imposed by central HR. It was a rather effective action meeting: all agenda points of changes in roles/responsibilities between the different HR departments were covered quite rapidly with short-term actions, except one!</description>

      <title>Polarities: a systemic approach for business dilemma</title>
      <link>https://s66erge.github.io/theagilecompany/post/polarities/</link>

      <guid>https://s66erge.github.io/theagilecompany/post/polarities/</guid>
      <description>Whenever we are confronted with conflicts around business dilemmas or complex challenges, one or more polarity(ies) could be the root cause(s). Some examples are:
 Centralized versus Decentralized Reduce cost versus Improve quality Compete versus Collaborate Take care of the organization versus Take care of the customer Deliberate strategy versus Emergent strategy Focus on task versus Focus on relationship Verify versus Trust Advocacy versus Inquiry  A polarity is composed of two opposites which do not function well independently.</description>

      <title>Structured self-management in business decision making: agile decisions</title>

      <description>Effective complex business decisions are threatened by many potential biases When it comes to (very) complex business decision making, we are not only confronted with the risk of ineffective interactions in meetings, but also with the risk of falling individually and collectively into different decision making biases. These biases are now well documented in the recent field of behavioral economics1. So it is also proven that the following subconscious biases do directly impact many, many business decisions2:</description>

      <description>Fight silos by helping your team members to evolve their behaviors Henry, the head of the management team of the technology group of a worldwide IT company, was concerned about the mistrust between his team members and their silo mentality behaviors: they were always giving more priority to the results of their own departments, even at the expense of the overall results of the whole technology group.
Henry asked us to run 3 half-day team-building sessions to strengthen mutual trust and reduce the silo behavior of team members.</description>

      <description>Lack of meeting structures creates weak decision making processes Few subjects do trigger a quasi unanimity in business and one of them is: meetings are too often a waste of time! Just observe your next meetings and you will rapidly see that the reality diverges frequently from generally accepted good practices:
   Good meeting practices Frequent meeting reality     participants remain on one subject until some agreed type of closure participants change subject before any apparent closure   group clarity on &amp;ldquo;diverging&amp;rdquo; (to brainstorm &amp;amp; share ideas) versus &amp;ldquo;converging&amp;rdquo; conversations unclear mix of &amp;ldquo;diverging&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;converging&amp;rdquo; (to take decisions) conversations   air time captured by one/few participant(s) air time actively distributed to everybody   almost every agenda item gets addressed many agenda items are delayed to next meeting(s)   everybody can speak without being interrupted interruptions do happen     Daniel, the Finance director of a large European country organization of a global software company, was looking at the yearly employee survey for his department.</description>

      <title>Structured self-management is agility: BOTH creativity AND cooperation</title>

      <description>Using hierarchical control for alignment &amp;amp; collaboration is killing creativity Since they exist, almost all companies are using hierarchical control to ensure alignment and collaboration. The same companies need also creative employees at every level in order to thrive or just to survive! We know that self-management is the first and most important driver of human engagement and creativity: this has been proven since the 80s in psychology research1 and in real companies2.</description>
